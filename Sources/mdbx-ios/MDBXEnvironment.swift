  /** \brief Set all size-related parameters of environment, including page size
   * and the min/max size of the memory map. \ingroup c_settings
   *
   * In contrast to LMDB, the MDBX provide automatic size management of an
   * database according the given parameters, including shrinking and resizing
   * on the fly. From user point of view all of these just working. Nevertheless,
   * it is reasonable to know some details in order to make optimal decisions
   * when choosing parameters.
   *
   * Both \ref mdbx_env_info_ex() and legacy \ref mdbx_env_info() are inapplicable
   * to read-only opened environment.
   *
   * Both \ref mdbx_env_info_ex() and legacy \ref mdbx_env_info() could be called
   * either before or after \ref mdbx_env_open(), either within the write
   * transaction running by current thread or not:
   *
   *  - In case \ref mdbx_env_info_ex() or legacy \ref mdbx_env_info() was called
   *    BEFORE \ref mdbx_env_open(), i.e. for closed environment, then the
   *    specified parameters will be used for new database creation, or will be
   *    applied during opening if database exists and no other process using it.
   *
   *    If the database is already exist, opened with \ref MDBX_EXCLUSIVE or not
   *    used by any other process, and parameters specified by
   *    \ref mdbx_env_set_geometry() are incompatible (i.e. for instance,
   *    different page size) then \ref mdbx_env_open() will return
   *    \ref MDBX_INCOMPATIBLE error.
   *
   *    In another way, if database will opened read-only or will used by other
   *    process during calling \ref mdbx_env_open() that specified parameters will
   *    silently discarded (open the database with \ref MDBX_EXCLUSIVE flag
   *    to avoid this).
   *
   *  - In case \ref mdbx_env_info_ex() or legacy \ref mdbx_env_info() was called
   *    after \ref mdbx_env_open() WITHIN the write transaction running by current
   *    thread, then specified parameters will be applied as a part of write
   *    transaction, i.e. will not be visible to any others processes until the
   *    current write transaction has been committed by the current process.
   *    However, if transaction will be aborted, then the database file will be
   *    reverted to the previous size not immediately, but when a next transaction
   *    will be committed or when the database will be opened next time.
   *
   *  - In case \ref mdbx_env_info_ex() or legacy \ref mdbx_env_info() was called
   *    after \ref mdbx_env_open() but OUTSIDE a write transaction, then MDBX will
   *    execute internal pseudo-transaction to apply new parameters (but only if
   *    anything has been changed), and changes be visible to any others processes
   *    immediately after succesful completion of function.
   *
   * Essentially a concept of "automatic size management" is simple and useful:
   *  - There are the lower and upper bound of the database file size;
   *  - There is the growth step by which the database file will be increased,
   *    in case of lack of space.
   *  - There is the threshold for unused space, beyond which the database file
   *    will be shrunk.
   *  - The size of the memory map is also the maximum size of the database.
   *  - MDBX will automatically manage both the size of the database and the size
   *    of memory map, according to the given parameters.
   *
   * So, there some considerations about choosing these parameters:
   *  - The lower bound allows you to prevent database shrinking below some
   *    rational size to avoid unnecessary resizing costs.
   *  - The upper bound allows you to prevent database growth above some rational
   *    size. Besides, the upper bound defines the linear address space
   *    reservation in each process that opens the database. Therefore changing
   *    the upper bound is costly and may be required reopening environment in
   *    case of \ref MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE errors, and so on. Therefore, this
   *    value should be chosen reasonable as large as possible, to accommodate
   *    future growth of the database.
   *  - The growth step must be greater than zero to allow the database to grow,
   *    but also reasonable not too small, since increasing the size by little
   *    steps will result a large overhead.
   *  - The shrink threshold must be greater than zero to allow the database
   *    to shrink but also reasonable not too small (to avoid extra overhead) and
   *    not less than growth step to avoid up-and-down flouncing.
   *  - The current size (i.e. size_now argument) is an auxiliary parameter for
   *    simulation legacy \ref mdbx_env_set_mapsize() and as workaround Windows
   *    issues (see below).
   *
   * Unfortunately, Windows has is a several issues
   * with resizing of memory-mapped file:
   *  - Windows unable shrinking a memory-mapped file (i.e memory-mapped section)
   *    in any way except unmapping file entirely and then map again. Moreover,
   *    it is impossible in any way if a memory-mapped file is used more than
   *    one process.
   *  - Windows does not provide the usual API to augment a memory-mapped file
   *    (that is, a memory-mapped partition), but only by using "Native API"
   *    in an undocumented way.
   *
   * MDBX bypasses all Windows issues, but at a cost:
   *  - Ability to resize database on the fly requires an additional lock
   *    and release `SlimReadWriteLock during` each read-only transaction.
   *  - During resize all in-process threads should be paused and then resumed.
   *  - Shrinking of database file is performed only when it used by single
   *    process, i.e. when a database closes by the last process or opened
   *    by the first.
   *  = Therefore, the size_now argument may be useful to set database size
   *    by the first process which open a database, and thus avoid expensive
   *    remapping further.
   *
   * For create a new database with particular parameters, including the page
   * size, \ref mdbx_env_set_geometry() should be called after
   * \ref mdbx_env_create() and before mdbx_env_open(). Once the database is
   * created, the page size cannot be changed. If you do not specify all or some
   * of the parameters, the corresponding default values will be used. For
   * instance, the default for database size is 10485760 bytes.
   *
   * If the mapsize is increased by another process, MDBX silently and
   * transparently adopt these changes at next transaction start. However,
   * \ref mdbx_txn_begin() will return \ref MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE if new
   * mapping size could not be applied for current process (for instance if
   * address space is busy).  Therefore, in the case of
   * \ref MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE error you need close and reopen the
   * environment to resolve error.
   *
   * \note Actual values may be different than your have specified because of
   * rounding to specified database page size, the system page size and/or the
   * size of the system virtual memory management unit. You can get actual values
   * by \ref mdbx_env_sync_ex() or see by using the tool `mdbx_chk` with the `-v`
   * option.
   *
   * Legacy \ref mdbx_env_set_mapsize() correspond to calling
   * \ref mdbx_env_set_geometry() with the arguments `size_lower`, `size_now`,
   * `size_upper` equal to the `size` and `-1` (i.e. default) for all other
   * parameters.
   *
   * \param [in] env         An environment handle returned
   *                         by \ref mdbx_env_create()
   *
   * \param [in] size_lower  The lower bound of database size in bytes.
   *                         Zero value means "minimal acceptable",
   *                         and negative means "keep current or use default".
   *
   * \param [in] size_now    The size in bytes to setup the database size for
   *                         now. Zero value means "minimal acceptable", and
   *                         negative means "keep current or use default". So,
   *                         it is recommended always pass -1 in this argument
   *                         except some special cases.
   *
   * \param [in] size_upper The upper bound of database size in bytes.
   *                        Zero value means "minimal acceptable",
   *                        and negative means "keep current or use default".
   *                        It is recommended to avoid change upper bound while
   *                        database is used by other processes or threaded
   *                        (i.e. just pass -1 in this argument except absolutely
   *                        necessary). Otherwise you must be ready for
   *                        \ref MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE error(s), unexpected
   *                        pauses during remapping and/or system errors like
   *                        "address busy", and so on. In other words, there
   *                        is no way to handle a growth of the upper bound
   *                        robustly because there may be a lack of appropriate
   *                        system resources (which are extremely volatile in
   *                        a multi-process multi-threaded environment).
   *
   * \param [in] growth_step  The growth step in bytes, must be greater than
   *                          zero to allow the database to grow. Negative value
   *                          means "keep current or use default".
   *
   * \param [in] shrink_threshold  The shrink threshold in bytes, must be greater
   *                               than zero to allow the database to shrink and
   *                               greater than growth_step to avoid shrinking
